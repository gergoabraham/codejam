# Google's Code Jam 2021

## Competitive submissions

### Round 0: Qualification round

`Reversort` and `Reversort engineering` are fully, `Moons and Umbrellas` and `Cheating detection` are partly solved.

[Here](https://codingcompetitions.withgoogle.com/codejam/submissions/000000000043580a/Z2VyZ29vbw) are my submissions.

### Round 1A

In the first problem I made two errors, because didn't think about two scenarios. I was able to fix them, so the 3rd submission passed both test sets. Which I think is not bad considering that the round took time between 3am and 5:30am in local time. `¯\(◉‿◉)/¯`

Second problem: 2 of 3 test sets are solved.

That means 46 points of 100 which was enough for position 2715th. [Here](https://codingcompetitions.withgoogle.com/codejam/submissions/000000000043585d/Z2VyZ29vbw) are my submissions.

### Round 1B

I was able to solve the first problem. Time, math, equation system combined with technical issues like too large numbers. [Here](https://codingcompetitions.withgoogle.com/codejam/submissions/0000000000435baf/Z2VyZ29vbw) is my solution. This is 30 points, for position **1811th**.

### Round 1C

First problem is solved, 25 points, 3603rd position. [Here](https://codingcompetitions.withgoogle.com/codejam/submissions/00000000004362d7/00000000005bdbd4).
