# Google's Code Jam 2021
In progress...

## Competitive submissions
### Round 0: Qualification round
`Reversort` and `Reversort engineering` are fully, `Moons and Umbrellas` and `Cheating detection` are partly solved.

[Here](https://codingcompetitions.withgoogle.com/codejam/submissions/000000000043580a/Z2VyZ29vbw) are my submissions.

### Round 1A
In the first problem I made two errors, because didn't think about two scenarios. I was able to fix them, so the 3rd submission passed both test sets. Which I think is not bad considering that the round took time between 3am and 5:30am in local time. `¯\(◉‿◉)/¯`

Second problem: 2 of 3 test sets are solved.

That means 46 points of 100. [Here](https://codingcompetitions.withgoogle.com/codejam/submissions/000000000043585d/Z2VyZ29vbw) are my submissions.
