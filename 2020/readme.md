# Google's Code Jam 2020
Just like last year, I've attended the Code Jam 2020 competition this year, too. I was able to improve my results compared to last year, still I couldn't meet my goal of passing round 1 and bleeding out in round 2. My best result was **the 1520th place**. Almost. :-)

## Competitive submissions
### Round 0: Qualification round
I've succeeded to solve the first 3 problems in the qualification round for 42 points.

### Round 1B
First problem: 2 of 3 tests sets,
second problem: 1 of 3 tests sets solved.

16 points, not in the first 1500 competitors (final position is 3527th). :-( [Here](https://codingcompetitions.withgoogle.com/codejam/submissions/000000000019fef2/Z2VyZ29vbw) are my submissions.

### Round 1C
It was an exciting round! **And my best result so far**.

I was able to fully solve the 1th and 2nd problems with the first attempt. They were such interesting problems, especially the second one, where a statistical approach solved all the test cases.

For the 3rd problem, I couldn't produce a general solution after a lot of thinking, so I chose to implement a specific solution for the first test case. I submitted my solution 7 minutes before the end, but my code gave wrong answer. In the last 2 minutes I found that I missed a scenario, so I tried to fix it, and then... the time was up. I was able to give a correct solution for the first test case 7 minutes after the deadline. :-)

**My final position was the 1520th**, [here](https://codingcompetitions.withgoogle.com/codejam/submissions/000000000019fef4/Z2VyZ29vbw) are my submissions.
