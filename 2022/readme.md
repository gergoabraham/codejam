# Google's Code Jam 2022

## Competitive submissions

### Round 0: Qualification round

`Punched cards`, `3D printing` and `d1000000` are fully solved, and `Chain reactions` is partly solved.

### Round 1B

**4591st**

`Pancake deque` is fully solved, including the hidden test set.
I managed to solve the first part of the interactive problem, `ASeDatAb`, with a naive solution: give exactly the same number of `1`s that is in the record currently.

Regarding the 2nd challenge, `Controlled inflation`, the idea came too late: I finished it 20 minutes after the end of the competition. `ʘ︵ʘ`
It came to my mind that it could be a simplified graph and e.g. Dijkstra's shortest path algorithm can solve the problem, so having inspiration from that, I was able to implement a linear time dynamic programming solution.

### Round 1C

**2368th**

I was able to fully solve the 1st challenge, `Letter Blocks`. [Here](https://codingcompetitions.withgoogle.com/codejam/submissions/0000000000877b42/00000000005bdbd4) are my submissions.
